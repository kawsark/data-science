# Predicting house prices

Prediction of house prices is a classic ML problem to estimate the price of a house based on features such as sq. ft, age, location and so on. In these problems, price is the dependent variable and you use one or more independent variables for price prediction. In this module, we present a few example notebooks for house price prediction.
